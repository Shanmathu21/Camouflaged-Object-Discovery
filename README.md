## 🧠 Overview

This repository presents a **TensorFlow  reimplementation** of the **Saliency Enhancement Network (SEN)** module from the original **CIRCOD** framework.  
Our goal is to reproduce and simplify the key idea behind **Co-Saliency Inspired Referring Camouflaged Object Discovery**, which detects objects concealed within their surroundings by leveraging an additional **referring image**.

The model performs **camouflaged object segmentation** on benchmark datasets such as **COD10K**, **NC4K**, and **CAMO**, demonstrating the applicability of TensorFlow for this challenging visual task.

### Key Components
- **ConvBlocks** – Extract local and structural features.  
- **ConvTransposeBlocks** – Upsample and reconstruct spatial details.  
- **Skip Connections** – Preserve high-frequency information between encoder and decoder.  
- **Sigmoid Output Layer** – Produces the binary camouflage mask.

## 📜 Abstract

Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that are visually similar to their background. The challenge arises from minimal contrast between the object and its surroundings.  
By incorporating a **referring image** where the target object is clearly visible, we can better locate the same object when it is camouflaged.  

The CIRCOD framework introduces a novel problem setup — **Referring Camouflaged Object Discovery (RCOD)**.  
Here, segmentation occurs *only if* the object in the referring image is also present in the camouflaged image. Otherwise, the model returns a blank mask.  

To achieve this, CIRCOD proposes:
- **Co-Saliency-Aware Image Transformation (CAIT)** – Reduces appearance and structural variations.  
- **Co-Salient Object Discovery (CSOD)** – Exploits similarities between referring and camouflaged images.  

This repository focuses on implementing and training the **SEN** component of the full CIRCOD pipeline.
